# Todo List

This program is a simple terminal based todo list application that I created to practice OOP concepts like inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism and encapsulation as well as dates and times in Java. Individuals can create a user which contains task lists consisting of tasks with properties like task, deadline and completion status.

## Description

Todo List features a clean and intuitive terminal based UI that users can interact with to create a user, create task lists and fill the task list with tasks.

The app contains comprehensive error handling for invalid inputs and can smartly parse dates to be used for task deadlines. Task lists are then ordered and consistently updated in order of task deadlines from soonest to latest. Tasks and task lists can easily be created, deleted and marked completed.
